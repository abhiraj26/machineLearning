Module 1 coverage:
1. Rule of sum : n objects of first type and k objects of second type , so there are n+k objects of one of two types.
2. Rule of Product : n objects of the first type and k objects of second type and you want to select a pair then there are n*k objects of the first and second type.
3. Tuples : sequences of length k out of n symbols (symbols can be repeated) then total symbols are n^k.
4. Sets : n objects of first type and k objects of second type , so there are occ(n) + occ(k) - occ(n and k). occ-> occurence
5. k-Permutations : sequences of length k with no repetitions composed out of n symbols : n*(n-1)....*(n-k+1) = nPk

Module 2 coverage: 
1. Combinatorics : sequences of length k in which order doesn't matter to be placed by n symbols n*(n-1)..(n-k+1) divided by k as everything will be repeated k times -> nCk => (n k) => n choose k. Combinations are also called as substes.
