Udemy Course :-> https://wipro.udemy.com/course/support-vector-machines-in-python/learn/lecture/12513656#overview <br>

<b>1. Welcome </b><br>
1. There will be 2 beginner's corner which talk about sklearn.svm.svc and choosing the hyperparameters and its applications. <br>
2. Necessary theory by studying about linear classifiers like logistic regression and SVM. We will learn about geometry behind SVM.
3. SVM is known as maximum margin classifiers.
4. Typical methods like Gradient descent doesn't work well for SVM, we take quadratic programming from the convex optimization course.
5. After linear SVM we will move to non SVM. We take duality concepts to do this. 
6. It is just an extension of Lagranges multipliers. 
7. Kernel trick is what we will use. 
8. SMO algorithm -> The most popular algorithm to train SVM.
9. Neural netowrks and SVM goes hand by hand. 

<b> 2. Beginner's Corner </b>
1. Mostly sckit SVM usage and hyperparameters use. <br>
2. from sklearn.svm import SVC, we have to normalize as SVM is scale sensitive. SO we can divide by 255 for an image. 

<b> 3. Review of Linear Classifiers </b>
